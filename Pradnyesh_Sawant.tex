\section{Flipkart Internet pvt ltd (Bangalore, India)}
\cventry {18/08--present}{Engineering Manager}{https://www.flipkart.com}
         {Technology: Java (Dropwizard)}{Team size: 11}
         {\begin{itemize}
           \item \textbf{Games}: We currently have 2 live games, \textit{Quiz Up} (peak of 172k simultaneous game plays) and \textit{Guess What} (1.39M game plays in a single day). Some of the big challenges in building these were related to how to
           \begin{itemize}
           \item include a game in an e-commerce app while having strict limitations on the app size
           \item synchronize time between server and client so that every user playing \textit{Quiz Up} gets the exact same question at the exact same time
           \item detect and avoid fraudulent behavior
           \end{itemize}
           \item \textbf{Communication Platform}: This is the central platform via which we send all external communications to flipkart users, sellers, etc through the channels of \textit{Push Notification}, \textit{Email},  \textit{SMS}, \textit{WhatsApp}, \textit{Web Push} and \textit{In App}. This is a super huge scale project where we send upwards of 1 billion PNs and 80 million emails in a single day (during BBD). This system includes a \textit{Frequency Capping System} and \textit{Communication Preferences} that act as guardrails against user fatigue.
           \item \textbf{App Referrals}: This is the revival of an existing project that was taken down due to massive frauds. The revamp included, besides better rules for fraud detection, development of a deferred incentivization policy via a state machine implementation.
