         {Team size: 20}{Technology: J2EE}
         {The project involved from scratch re-write of the ``In App Purchase'' part of Samsung Apps server using J2EE technologies (Spring framework, JBoss, Informatica Power Center for ETL, etc). I functioned as the Engineering Manager for this project and the sole representative from HQ responsible for managing the outsourced team (Samsung Research, Poland (SRPOL)) and releasing the server with good quality (around 900+ CI powered unit tests) on schedule. Some of the biggest challenges for me working in this project were finding a common ground between 2 radically different and opposing cultures (Korean and Polish), and also drawing up the business and logic requirements from an old and undocumented, but in service, codebase. I was also responsible for the smooth migration of codebase and knowledge from SRPOL to SDC, Korea towards the end of SRPOL contract; and later for guiding and managing SDC team members.}

         {This project is a collection of 6 entertainment related websites (*.omg.yahoo.com built for Indonesia, Brazil, India, Middle-East, Mexico and Espanol). The admirable thing about this project is that it was built in parallel with the platform, which supported us and also another property (LifestyleLite), in just 5 months. In this project I worked on the performance analysis and continuous integration (CI) of both EntertainmentLite and LifestyleLite and made architectural decisions for the common modules and website specific components.} % I was responsible for managing the sprints and ensuring that the team delivered quality code within the deadlines. In addition, I managed all inter-team collaboration, feeds related issues and editorial training. I was also largely responsible for the RTL-ization of the middle-east website.}
