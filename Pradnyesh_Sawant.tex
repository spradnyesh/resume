\cventry {18/Aug -- Present}{Engineering Manager}{}
         {Technology: Java, Mongo, HBase, Storm, Kafka, Redis}{Team size: 19}
         {\begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Games}: We currently have 4 live games, 2 simultaneous (\textit{Quiz Up} and \textit{Crazy Cannon}) and 2 non simultaneous (\textit{Snake Smash} and \textit{Guess What}). These games run on a daily basis with real money rewards. Some of the biggest challenges in building these were
              \begin{itemize}
                \item include games in an e-commerce app while having strict limitations on the app size
                \item point in time load to backend servers for simultaneous games at very high scale
                \item synchronize time between server and client so that every user playing \textit{Quiz Up} and \textit{Crazy Cannon} gets the exact same question/layout at the exact same time and the winners are calculated immediately after the game ends based on their scores
                \item detect and avoid fraudulent behavior
                \item collaboration between 3 teams including an external vendor for the UI part of core gameplay
              \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Communication Platform}: This is the central platform via which we send all external communications to Flipkart users, sellers, etc through the channels of \textit{Push Notification}, \textit{Email},  \textit{SMS}, \textit{WhatsApp}, \textit{Web Push} and \textit{In App}. This is a extremely high scale project where we send upwards of 1 billion PNs and 80 million emails in a single day (during BBD). This system includes a \textit{Frequency Capping System} and \textit{Communication Preferences} that act as guardrails against user fatigue.
            \item \textbf{Other projects}
            \begin{itemize}
              \item Customer Referrals
              \item Incentivized actions (aka Gamification)
              \item Mystery box
            \end{itemize}
            \item As the Engineering Manager, some of my core responsibilities include
            \begin{itemize}
              \item define the project roadmap while working closely with the Product Manager
              \item split the roadmap into quarterly chunks to define the OKRs
              \item be responsible for the quality and timely delivery of OKR commitments
              \item inter team dependency resolution
              \item help each team member to define their development goals and mentor and work with them to help them achieve the same

I functioned as the Engineering Manager for this project and the sole representative from HQ responsible for managing the outsourced team (Samsung Research, Poland (SRPOL)) and releasing the server with good quality (around 900+ CI powered unit tests) on schedule. Some of the biggest challenges for me working in this project were finding a common ground between 2 radically different and opposing cultures (Korean and Polish), and also drawing up the business and logic requirements from an old and undocumented, but in service, codebase. I was also responsible for the smooth migration of codebase and knowledge from SRPOL to SDC, Korea towards the end of SRPOL contract; and later for guiding and managing SDC team members.}
